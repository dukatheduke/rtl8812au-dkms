#Realtek 802.11ac (rtl8812au) Linux Driver Version 4.3.8

The driver was originally from [HERE](http://www.comfast.cn/upload/%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6%E9%A9%B1%E5%8A%A8/%E7%BD%91%E5%8D%A1%E7%B1%BB/8812AU%20912%E3%80%817500AC/linux/RTL8812AU_linux_v4.3.8_12175.20140902.zip).  

The driver was tested on **Raspberry Pi 2** under updated **ArchLinux ARM** for **Comfast CF-912AC**. It should be compatible with other WiFi USB adapters with the same chip of 8812au inside.  

The default platform is X86. You should change the target platform in Makefile if you want to build for different architectures.  


Note that the kernel should has configuration as below<sup>[1]</sup>:
